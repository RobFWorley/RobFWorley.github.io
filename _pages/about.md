This website says a bit about me and about the work that I've done over the last few years.

Previously, I have been working on the Pipebots project, developing technology for inspecting buried pipes with robots.

Currently I am working on the Pipebot Patrol project, where I am getting our sensing, mapping, and autonomy technology into real-world pipe environments.
