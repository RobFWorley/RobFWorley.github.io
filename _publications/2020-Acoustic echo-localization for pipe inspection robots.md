excerpt: 'This paper proposes the use of acoustic echo sensing for robots in pipe networks, and develops an algorithm for using this sensing in localization. This sensing approach increases the robot&apos;s perspective compared to the use of typical sensors such as vision, which are limited in range in this environment.'

This paper proposes the use of acoustic echo sensing for robots in pipe networks, and develops an algorithm for using this sensing in localization. This sensing approach increases the robot&apos;s perspective compared to the use of typical sensors such as vision, which are limited in range in this environment.
