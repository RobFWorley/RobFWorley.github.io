excerpt: 'This paper further develops the use of acoustic echoes for robot localization in a pipe. The localization algorithm is improved to facilitate measurements in more realistic and challenging environments than in previous work. The sensing, perception, and localization approaches are all evaluated in more thorough experiments than in previous work. This is likely as far as localization can be developed for this environment using only acoustic sensing; future work would need further experimental validation in a field robotics context, and need to combine information from multiple sensors.'
