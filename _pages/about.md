This is my personal academic webpage, which says a little bit about me and about the work that I've done over the last few years.

Currently, I am making the most of the remaining funding for the Pipebots project, and continuing developing technology within my group and in collaboration with my colleagues at the University of Leeds.

From March, I will be changing focus to the Pipebot Patrol project, where I will be working towards getting our sensing, mapping, and autonomy technology into real-world pipe environments.
