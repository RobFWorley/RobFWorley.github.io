The sources of uncertainty which cause an increase in estimate error are identified. Alternative state definitions are propsed which result in different values of efficiency, in terms of estimate accuracy relative to the required computational time. On reflection, the attempt to improve efficiency by using the proposed state definition went too far away from the typical state definition; this motivated further work to find a compromise between the two approaches.\"\t\"Worley, R., Anderson, S.

      "29/09/2020\tRobot Localization in Water Pipes Using Acoustic Signals and Pose Graph Optimization\tSensors\t\"This paper continues work done by a colleague, which uses a hydrophone sensor to measure a physical property of a pipe. This varies when the measurement is made by a robot at different points along the pipe, and therefore can be used to localize a robot. This work develops this localization approach by applying the sensing approach to pose-graph optimization. On reflection, this work shows that this sensing could be useful in the case where sensors like vision are unavailable or unsuitable due to the feature-sparseness of the pipe. However, like the use of vision, this approach suffers from a fundamental limitation on its perspective, which motivates further work to overcome this.\"\t\"R.
