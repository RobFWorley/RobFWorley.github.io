I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Robot Navigation at the University of Sheffield in the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, where I work with the Pipebots project.

I have worked alongside the Pipebots project for a few years while I studied towards a PhD degree in the same department where I was funded by an EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership Scholarship.

Prior to this, I studied towards an MEng degree in Integrated Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at the University of Bath. Towards the end of this degree I began working in the field of robot localization, where I worked on sonar-based localization for underwater robots.

Moving back towards the present, I have since continued working in the same field, this time in localization of robots in buried pipe networks, through my PhD degree and current research position.
