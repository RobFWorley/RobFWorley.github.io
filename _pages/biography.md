I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in Robot Navigation at the University of Sheffield in the Department of Automatic Control and Systems Engineering, where I am funded by the Pipebots project.

I have worked alongside the Pipebots project for a few years while I studied towards a PhD degree in the same department where I was funded by an EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership Scholarship.

Prior to this, I studied towards an MEng degree in Integrated Mechanical and Electrical Engineering at the University of Bath. Towards the end of this degree I began working in the field of robot localization, where I worked on sonar-based localization for underwater robots.

Moving back towards the present, I have since continued working in the same field, this time in localization of robots in buried pipe networks, through my PhD degree and current research position.

My research now localization for robots in buried pipe networks focuses on two main aspects:

* Developing sensing for robot localization which is suitable for robots in this environment: The most appropriate sensing may differ from typical sensing approaches taken in other environments.
* Developing the state definition for robot localization: The most appropriate state definition for a given problem might be different from what is used typically.
