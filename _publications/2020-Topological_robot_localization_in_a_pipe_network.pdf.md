excerpt: 'To do robot localization, the robot state to be estimate has to be defined. This paper proposes the use of a discrete (topological) robot state definition for robots in pipe networks, as an alternative to the traditional continuous (metric) approach which is not well suited to this constrained environment.'

To do robot localization, the robot state to be estimate has to be defined. This paper proposes the use of a discrete (topological) robot state definition for robots in pipe networks, as an alternative to the traditional continuous (metric) approach which is not well suited to this constrained environment.
