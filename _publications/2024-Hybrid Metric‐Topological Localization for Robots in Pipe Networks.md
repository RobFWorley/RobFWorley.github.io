excerpt: 'This paper further develops localization in a large-scale pipe network. This approach could be applied to any network environment, but is especially suited to the limited sensing available for robots in pipe networks. The approach uses a hybrid metric-topological state space, where the state to be estimated contains both continuous and discrete variables. 
Compared to our previous results, the estimation approach is more robust to most sources of input uncertainty and requires lower computation.'
