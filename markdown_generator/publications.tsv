06/05/2020	Topological Robot Localization in a Pipe Network	published	UKRAS20 Conference Robots into the real world Proceedings	"To do robot localization, the robot state to be estimate has to be defined. This paper proposes the use of a discrete (topological) robot state definition for robots in pipe networks, as an alternative to the traditional continuous (metric) approach which is not well suited to this constrained environment."

The sources of uncertainty which cause an increase in estimate error are identified. Alternative state definitions are propsed which result in different values of efficiency, in terms of estimate accuracy relative to the required computational time. On reflection, the attempt to improve efficiency by using the proposed state definition went too far away from the typical state definition; this motivated further work to find a compromise between the two approaches."

29/09/2020	Robot Localization in Water Pipes Using Acoustic Signals and Pose Graph Optimization	published	Sensors	"This paper continues work done by a colleague, which uses a hydrophone sensor to measure a physical property of a pipe. This varies when the measurement is made by a robot at different points along the pipe, and therefore can be used to localize a robot. This work develops this localization approach by applying the sensing approach to pose-graph optimization. On reflection, this work shows that this sensing could be useful in the case where sensors like vision are unavailable or unsuitable due to the feature-sparseness of the pipe. However, like the use of vision, this approach suffers from a fundamental limitation on its perspective, which motivates further work to overcome this."	"R.

21/02/2023	Acoustic Echo Sensing for Robot Localization in Buried Pipe Networks	preprint	TechrXiv	"This paper further develops the use of acoustic echoes for robot localization in a pipe. The localization algorithm is improved to facilitate measurements in more realistic and challenging environments than in previous work. The sensing, perception, and localization approaches are all evaluated in more thorough experiments than in previous work. This is likely as far as localization can be developed for this environment using only acoustic sensing; future work would need further experimental validation in a field robotics context, and need to combine information from multiple sensors."
