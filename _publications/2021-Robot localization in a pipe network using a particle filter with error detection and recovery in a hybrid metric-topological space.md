excerpt: 'This paper shows some improvements to an algorithm based on a hybrid continuous-discrete (metric-topological) robot state definition. Specifically, it presents an approach to the challenging problem of error detection in this environment in the case of limited sensor information, and it presents an approach to error recovery which uses the constraints of the environment to its advantage.'

This paper shows some improvements to an algorithm based on a hybrid continuous-discrete (metric-topological) robot state definition. Specifically, it presents an approach to the challenging problem of error detection in this environment in the case of limited sensor information, and it presents an approach to error recovery which uses the constraints of the environment to its advantage.
