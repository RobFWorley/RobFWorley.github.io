excerpt: 'This paper continues work done by a colleague, which uses a hydrophone sensor to measure a physical property of a pipe. This varies when the measurement is made by a robot at different points along the pipe, and therefore can be used to localize a robot. This work develops this localization approach by applying the sensing approach to pose-graph optimization. On reflection, this work shows that this sensing could be useful in the case where sensors like vision are unavailable or unsuitable due to the feature-sparseness of the pipe. However, like the use of vision, this approach suffers from a fundamental limitation on its perspective, which motivates further work to overcome this.'

This paper continues work done by a colleague, which uses a hydrophone sensor to measure a physical property of a pipe. This varies when the measurement is made by a robot at different points along the pipe, and therefore can be used to localize a robot. This work develops this localization approach by applying the sensing approach to pose-graph optimization. On reflection, this work shows that this sensing could be useful in the case where sensors like vision are unavailable or unsuitable due to the feature-sparseness of the pipe. However, like the use of vision, this approach suffers from a fundamental limitation on its perspective, which motivates further work to overcome this.
